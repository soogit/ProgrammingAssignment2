## The following code creates two functions to calculate the inverse of a matrix
## and storing the inverse value of that matrix in an object which can be cached
## by the second fucntion if the inverse value of the same matrix already exits 
## in the cache to save the computation.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    i <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        i <<- NULL
    }
    
    get <- function() x
    setinverse <- function(solve) i <<- solve
    getinverse <- function() i
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setinverse = setinverse,
         getinverse = getinverse)
    
}


##  This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above.
##  If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
##  then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    
    ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
    i <- x$getinverse()
    if(!is.null(i)) {
        message("getting cached data")
        return(i)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    i <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setinverse(i)
    i
}
